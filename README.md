### Goal
Create a simple model to detect phishing emails using text analysis.  
The project includes data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and a first baseline model.

---

### Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Phishing Email Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subhajournal/phishingemails)  
- Each email is labeled as *Safe* or *Phishing*
The model predicts the correct class based on the email text.

---

### Project Overview
We cleaned and prepared the dataset, then used a basic Logistic Regression model with text features.  
The results show good accuracy and recall for detecting phishing emails.
